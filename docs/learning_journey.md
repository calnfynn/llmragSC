# LLMRAG Project Learning Journey

## Project Overview
**Local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System for IPCC Report Chapters**

A comprehensive system for processing, chunking, and querying IPCC scientific reports with source tracking capabilities.

## Learning Sessions Log

### Session 1: Project Foundation & HTML Splitter Development
**Date:** [Previous session]
**Focus:** Core RAG system development and HTML processing

#### Key Learnings:
- **HTML Chunking Strategy**: Developed `HtmlTextSplitter` class for semantic document chunking
- **Source Tracking**: Implemented paragraph ID preservation for traceable responses
- **Document Processing**: Created pipeline for IPCC chapter ingestion and processing

#### Technical Achievements:
- âœ… Built `HtmlTextSplitter` with comprehensive docstrings and student explanations
- âœ… Resolved import errors and API mismatches in LangChain integration
- âœ… Created test scripts for IPCC chapter ingestion
- âœ… Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- âœ… Implemented declarative pipeline with YAML configuration

#### Challenges Overcome:
- **Import Path Issues**: Fixed module import problems in GitHub Actions
- **Python Version Compatibility**: Resolved version-specific API differences
- **Model Generation Errors**: Debugged and fixed local model integration issues

#### Code Quality Improvements:
- Added extensive docstrings with student-friendly explanations
- Implemented proper error handling and validation
- Created comprehensive test coverage

### Session 2: Current Session - Testing & Refinement
**Date:** Current session
**Focus:** Testing Gatsby â†’ HTML with IDs conversion and privacy considerations

#### Key Learnings:
- **Privacy in AI Development**: Understanding cloud-based AI service limitations and best practices
- **Offline Development**: Clarified internet connectivity requirements for AI assistance
- **Documentation Strategy**: Implementing structured learning logs for project evolution

#### Current Objectives:
- ðŸ”„ Test and refine Gatsby â†’ HTML with IDs conversion process

â””â”€â”€ pipelines/
    â””â”€â”€ rag_pipeline.py       # Main RAG orchestration
```

### Data Flow
1. **Ingestion**: HTML chapters â†’ Cleaned and structured
2. **Chunking**: Semantic splitting with ID preservation
3. **Embedding**: Vector representation generation
4. **Storage**: ChromaDB vector store
5. **Retrieval**: Semantic search with source tracking
6. **Generation**: Local LLM response generation

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. HTML Processing Strategy
- **Choice**: Semantic chunking over fixed-size chunks
- **Rationale**: Preserves document structure and context
- **Implementation**: XPath-based element extraction with size limits

### 2. Source Tracking Approach
- **Choice**: Paragraph ID preservation in metadata
- **Rationale**: Enables precise source attribution
- **Implementation**: ID collection per chunk with comma-separated storage

### 3. Local Development Focus
- **Choice**: Local LLM integration over cloud APIs
- **Rationale**: Privacy, cost control, and offline capability
- **Implementation**: Transformers-based local models

## Testing Strategy

### Current Test Files
- `tests/ipcc/wg1/chapter02/` - Primary test data
- `gatsby.html` â†’ `html_with_ids.html` conversion testing
- Paragraph ID preservation verification
- Content integrity validation

### Test Coverage Areas
- [ ] HTML parsing accuracy
- [ ] ID assignment correctness
- [ ] Chunk size compliance
- [ ] Metadata preservation
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

## Next Steps & Roadmap

### Immediate (Current Session)
- [ ] Analyze Gatsby â†’ HTML with IDs conversion quality
- [ ] Identify improvement opportunities
- [ ] Create automated testing for conversion process

### Short Term
- [ ] Implement conversion quality metrics
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Create user documentation

### Long Term
- [ ] Scale to full IPCC report processing
- [ ] Add advanced query capabilities
- [ ] Implement web interface

## Lessons Learned

### Development Practices
1. **Documentation First**: Comprehensive docstrings aid both development and learning
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Automated testing prevents regression issues
3. **Privacy by Design**: Local processing reduces data exposure risks

### Technical Insights
1. **Semantic Chunking**: Better than fixed-size for document understanding
2. **Source Tracking**: Critical for scientific document credibility
3. **Local Processing**: Enables offline development and privacy

### Project Management
1. **Structured Learning**: Documenting journey aids knowledge retention
2. **Iterative Development**: Small, testable improvements over big changes
3. **Version Control**: Essential for tracking evolution and collaboration
