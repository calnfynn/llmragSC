## üìã Demo Script

### Introduction (2 minutes)

**"Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. Today I'm excited to show you a powerful new tool for climate research - the IPCC RAG System."**

**Key Points:**
- This is a **local RAG system** for IPCC climate reports
- It runs entirely on your computer (no internet needed after setup)
- It provides **accurate, sourced answers** to climate science questions
- It's designed for **researchers, policymakers, and students**

**"Let me show you how it works..."**

### System Overview (1 minute)

**"The system works in three simple steps:"**

1. **Load IPCC chapters** - We have multiple chapters from IPCC reports
2. **Ask questions** - Natural language questions about climate science
3. **Get answers** - Accurate responses with exact source citations

**"The magic is that it combines the power of AI with the authority of IPCC reports."**

### Live Demonstration (10 minutes)

#### Step 1: Show the Interface
**"Here's the web interface. It's clean and simple - just select a chapter and start asking questions."**

- Point out the chapter selector
- Show that `wg1/chapter02` is already loaded
- Explain this is "Changing State of the Climate System"

#### Step 2: Basic Question
**"Let's start with a fundamental question about climate change."**

**Question**: "What are the main findings about temperature trends?"

**What to highlight:**
- The system processes the question
- It searches through the IPCC content
- It generates a coherent, scientific answer
- It shows paragraph IDs for source tracking

**"Notice how the answer is scientifically accurate and includes specific paragraph IDs so you can verify the information."**

#### Step 3: Specific Data Question
**"Now let's ask for specific data and measurements."**

**Question**: "How much has the Earth warmed since pre-industrial times?"

**What to highlight:**
- Specific numerical values
- Units of measurement
- Confidence levels
- Time periods mentioned

**"This shows the system can provide precise, quantitative information from the IPCC reports."**

#### Step 4: Complex Relationship Question
**"Let's try a more complex question about relationships and mechanisms."**

**Question**: "What causes global warming?"

**What to highlight:**
- Clear explanation of mechanisms
- Scientific terminology
- Multiple factors considered
- Proper source citations

**"The system can explain complex scientific concepts in a clear, accessible way."**

#### Step 5: Uncertainty Question
**"One of the strengths of IPCC reports is their careful treatment of uncertainty. Let's test that."**

**Question**: "How certain are scientists about climate change?"

**What to highlight:**
- Discussion of confidence levels
- Acknowledgment of uncertainties
- Nuanced language about certainty
- Scientific rigor

**"This demonstrates the system's ability to handle nuanced scientific concepts."**

### Technical Highlights (2 minutes)

**"Let me quickly show you some technical aspects that make this system powerful:"**

#### Source Tracking
**"Every answer includes paragraph IDs from the original IPCC reports. This means you can:**
- **Verify information** by checking the original source
- **Cite properly** in your research
- **Understand context** by reading the surrounding paragraphs
- **Build trust** in the system's accuracy"

#### Local Operation
**"The system runs entirely on your computer:**
- **No internet required** after initial setup
- **Your data stays private**
- **No usage limits or costs**
- **Works offline** for research in remote locations"

#### Multiple Interfaces
**"We provide multiple ways to use the system:**
- **Web interface** - for interactive exploration
- **Command line** - for scripting and automation
- **Python API** - for integration with other tools"

### Use Cases and Benefits (2 minutes)

**"This system is valuable for several key audiences:"**

#### For Researchers
- **Quick literature reviews** - Get answers in seconds instead of hours
- **Fact-checking** - Verify specific claims against IPCC reports
- **Teaching** - Use in climate science courses
- **Policy support** - Access authoritative climate information

#### For Policymakers
- **Evidence-based decisions** - Direct access to IPCC findings
- **Rapid briefings** - Quick answers to climate questions
- **Stakeholder communication** - Clear, accurate information
- **Report preparation** - Proper citations and sources

#### For Students
- **Learning tool** - Interactive way to explore climate science
- **Research skills** - Practice asking good questions
- **Source evaluation** - Learn to check and cite sources
- **Scientific literacy** - Understand climate science concepts

### Future Development (1 minute)

**"We're actively developing this system with several exciting features planned:"**

- **More IPCC chapters** - Adding WG2 and WG3 reports
- **Better models** - Upgrading to larger language models
- **Multi-language support** - Non-English IPCC reports
- **Collaborative features** - Share questions and answers
- **Mobile app** - iOS and Android versions

### Q&A and Discussion (3 minutes)

**"I'd love to hear your thoughts and questions. What aspects would be most valuable for your work?"**

**Potential discussion points:**
- What types of questions would you ask?
- How could this fit into your research workflow?
- What additional features would be most useful?
- How could we improve the system?
